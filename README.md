The application is designed to facilitate a voting system.
Users are able to cast their votes for a predetermined set of candidates, with each user allowed to vote only once.
The system ensures that the user's email address is unique and cannot be used for multiple votes.
Additionally, an administrator has the ability to view the vote counts for each candidate.
